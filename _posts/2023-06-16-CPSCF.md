## Motivation

## CPSCF Equations

The CPSCF equations are derived from two conditions which need to be fullfilled by
the MO coefficients, in the presence of any types external perturbation.
These are the Orthonormality Condition, and the Brillouin Condition:

$$
\begin{align}
  S _{pq} = \delta _{pq} && f _{ai} = 0
\end{align}
$$
Differentiating these conditions w.r.t the perturbation parameter $\lambda$ gives us the constraints for the CPSCF coefficients $U _{pq}^{\lambda}$:
$$
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial S_{pq}}{\partial \lambda} = 0 && \pdv{f _{ai}}{\lambda} = 0
\end{align}
$$
Evaluating the first condition by expanding the overlap matrix:
$$
\begin{align}
  \pdv{S _{pq}}{\lambda} =& \pdv{\lambda}\sum_{\mu \nu}C _{\mu p}^{*}S _{\mu \nu}C _{\nu q} \nonumber \\
  0=& S _{pq}^{(\lambda)} + \sum_{\mu \nu}\sum_{r}\left\{\pdv{U _{rp}^{*}}{\lambda}C _{\mu r}^{*} S _{\mu \nu} C _{\nu q}
  + C _{\mu p}^{*}S _{\mu \nu}C _{\nu r}\pdv{U _{rq}}{\lambda}\right\} \nonumber \\
  0=& S _{pq}^{(\lambda)} + \sum_{r}\left\{U _{rp}^{*}S _{rq} + U _{rq}S _{pr}\right\}
\end{align}
$$
which leads to:
$$
\begin{align}
  0=& U _{qp}^{\lambda*} + S _{pq}^{(\lambda)} + U _{pq}^{\lambda}
\end{align}
$$
in which $S ^{(\lambda)}_{pq}$ represents the derivative of AO overlap matrix rotated into MO basis.
